Given a positive integer N, we define the set AN as {1, 2, 3, ... N-1, N}.

Find the size of the largest subset of AN, such that if x belongs to the subset, then 2x does not belong to the subset.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing a single integer N.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the size of the largest subset of AN satisfying the condition in the problem statement.


Sample Input:
4
1
2
3
4

Sample Output:
1
1
2
3

Explanation:
For test case 4, where N = 4, the subset {1, 3, 4} is the largest subset satisfying the conditions.
1 is in the subset whereas 2 is not.
3 is in the subset whereas 6 is not.
4 is in the subset whereas 8 is not.
